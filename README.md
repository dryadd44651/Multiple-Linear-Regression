# This is a R based Multiple Linear Regression Project
## Predict the PSA level for a patient

Consider the prostate cancer dataset prostate cancer.csv. It consists of
data on 97 men with advanced prostate cancer. A description of the variables is given in Figure 1.
We would like to understand how PSA level is related to the other predictors in the dataset.
Build a "reasonably good" linear model for these data by taking PSA level as the response variable.
Use the final model to predict the PSA level for a patient whose quantitative predictors are at the sample
means of the variables and qualitative predictors are at the most frequent category.

1. Select the data by p-value
2. Find the suitable transformation for data
3. Check the QQplot for transformation.
4. Estimate the PSA
